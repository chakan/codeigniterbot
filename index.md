## Why did you do this?

Recently I couldn't find any reliable bot that finds and promotes Codeigniter related contents, so I created one.

## How was it built?

This bot is built in [Codeigniter](https://codeigniter.com) and uses the awesome [Codebird](https://github.com/jublonet/codebird-php) PHP library to communicate with the Twitter API.

## What does it do?

- Keeps track of the [official Codeigniter forums](https://forum.codeigniter.com/) News section and posts any new news article that it can find.
- Checks for Codeigniter related tweets and favorites or retweets them following a magic formula.
- Checks mentions of itself and replies with a 32 character length encryption key.
